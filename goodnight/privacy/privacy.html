    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This app runs on Android and iOS platforms and uses the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Android permissions:

                <li>INTERNET (Internet permission)</li>
                <li>VIBRATE (Vibration permission)</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The app does not have any sign-up feature and operates solely on the client side without using any separate servers. Therefore, it does not collect personal information such as names or contact details directly.</p>

    <p>However, the app automatically collects the following data through SDKs such as Firebase Analytics, Remote Config, Crashlytics, Google AdMob, and AppLovin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App usage statistics and behavior analysis</li>
        <li>Remote configuration data</li>
        <li>App crash and error reports</li>
        <li>Advertising delivery and performance data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The collected data is used to improve app services, enhance user experience, and optimize advertising.</p>

    <p>Data processing may be outsourced to external providers such as Google and AppLovin who comply with relevant privacy laws.</p>

    <p>Users can limit data collection by resetting advertising IDs or changing app permission settings.</p>

    <p>For inquiries, please contact customer support within the app or by email.</p>
